        <h1><strong><u>Indentity, values and Strengths</u></strong></h1>
            <h2><strong>Using the evidence gathered, describe your core personal values.</strong></h2>
                <h3><em>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took</em></h3>
                    <p>This didn't actually happen to me personally but I was asked an opinion on what I would have done if it had been me. A friend had gone to a bank’s ATM and chose to withdraw $20 from their account. The machine decided to give her a $50 note instead. In her confusion she checked her account to see how much was actually taken out of her account and it was, in fact, just $20. She then came to work and asked me what she should do, should she keep it? I told her that she should take it back to the bank, explain the situation and show them evidence to back it up and explain that there may be a fault in the Machine and that they should look into it before it happened to others as well. I do not know if she heeded my words but 2 days later that same bank had reached out to the community to let them know what has been happening and if people could please come clean (not many people did).</p>
                <br>
                    <h3><em>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</em></h3>
                    <p>I wouldn't say my culture but definitely my family. Culture makes me think of where I am from, Thailand, and like hell I’d like to be the same as the vast majority of people who are from there. My dad is definitely very Thai, but the best kind. Kind, soft spoken, affectionate and understanding. He works hard to satisfy his wants and achieve results through determination and patience. I’d like to say that I got those from him (and my sister). They have shown me that hard work can put you along side people with talent and being kind and considerate takes you further than arrogance and intelligence. It shapes a very big part of me in the beginning but the friends that I was lucky enough to have in high school did a better job with me in my teens than my Mother. I had managed to surround myself with a group of kind, thoughtful and empathetic friends who were always there for each other and honestly made me think that everyone was like that until I went to Uni and realized, soon after, what I really had and how lucky I was.</p>

            <h2><strong>Using the evidence gathered, describe your strengths and limitations</strong></h2>
                    <h3><em>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</em></h3>
                    <p>It my culture (as in the people who shaped my life and not where I’m from) has influenced my sense of morality and ethics in what I think is the best possible ways. Work hard for what you want, be empathetic to any and everyone and value Quality in everything over Quantity. Prioritize your needs rather than your wants and work for it. Don't accept what you don’t deserve and demand only what is fair.</p>
                <br>
                    <h3><em>Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development</em></h3>
                    <p>My strengths are that I am determined and passionate, I put everything into what I do and I always see it through to the end (sometimes in a perfectionistic way)</p>
                    <p>My limitations/weaknesses with respect to the above is I can be sensitive and perfectionistic. I am harsh on myself when it comes to unsolicited advice or criticism and don't often express a lot of self-care. I will strive to be as perfect and complete in my task as possible but I often will expect the same of others and that at times cause conflict.</p>
                <br>
                    <h3><em>Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect with learning obstacles.</em></h3>
                    <p>Both of what is mentioned about will help me with my learning, but it may cause me to go into depth rather than breadth, which is what the course and Bootcamp, is about. There is always time (just-in-time leaning) to learn what is needed and understand that but it will be hard not to try to perfect it first time.</p>
                <br>
                    <h3><em>Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why</em></h3>
                    <p>I am a 2IC at my work, on of my duties requires me to be the manager on shift. One of the colleagues that I work with is much older than me, she had been in the industry (though not restaurant exactly) for longer and we often have disagreements over how things should be handled. The problems that often occur between us are somewhat akin to a power struggle. I am in a position of power but I am younger with more experience specifically in this feild, she is older and sees herself as more experienced in terms of length in time.</p>
                    <p>Once there was a table that was beginning to overstay their welcome, my colleague had refused to serve them more as she felt like they should leave. I decided to, as it was my management role to decide when a customer is not to be served. We huffed a little and I sent her home, as we no longer needed the extra person while we waited for them to leave and were starting our close down process. She felt strongly against this, as she wanted to help if we were to say but I sent her home anyway as that felt logical at the time. The result of my actions affected not only me but the rest of my team the following morning due to the fact that the events last night had caused her to feel resentment towards me and began to micro-manage the rest of the team throughout the rest of the service.</p>
                    <p>In hind sight, what I should have done was told her exactly what I thought the appropriate choice was before I made them in order to make her feel included and possibly come to an understanding of where I was coming from. I should have spoken to her directly after the fact and I was the one in a position of power and although her advice is much appreciated, I ultimately had the final say. Which means it is unacceptable for her to be acting this way towards the rest of the team the following morning. Had I spoken to her on the night however, we would not have had the problems that followed.</p>
