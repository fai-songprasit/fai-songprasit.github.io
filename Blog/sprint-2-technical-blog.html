        <h1><strong><u>What is the difference between Margin, Border, and Padding?</u></strong></h1>
        <h2>Lets start from the beginning...</h2>
            <p>Margin, Border and Padding are all styles that you can create in your CSS that will aid you in how to format your elements in HTML. But before we can talk about why they are different, we should first talk about what each of them do.</p>
            <h3><em>What is Margin?</em></h3>
                <p>The <em>margin</em> property is what defines the space around the HTML element. An example of an element is seen below.</p>
                <p><em><strong>example of HTML element:</strong></em></p>
                <div class= "example">
                <p>&lt;p&gt;I am an element&lt;p&gt;</p>
                </div>
                <p>The margin is the space between what you have in the element, which in this case is the paragraph &lt;p&gt;, and what it is surrounded by.</p>
                <p>Lets have a look at that example again, this time take into account the gray space that encases the text and the red line around it.</p>
                <div class="example_margin">
                <p>&lt;p&gt;I am an element&lt;p&gt;</p>
                </div>
                <p>Now that I've added some visual aid to the example, as mentioned before, think of the gray space as your element. The red line around it represents the size of its margin. You can set your code, this can be any code as long as it is in an element, to have a property that allows it to exist with the specified amount of red space from its neightbour.</p>
                <p><em>Still don't quite get it? Picture this. The element is the house you are about to build. The land you want to build on is between two other houses. Part of the building decision is where to put up your fence. The neighbour to your left plays loud music all the time, morning, noon and night, while the one to your right are lovely and quiet and owns two fluffy dogs. Becasue you like your sleep too much and also appreciate furry friends, you decide to build your fence closer to the right side (with the furry friends) and farther away from the left and all the noise. The fence represents your margin and what its value means.</em></p>
                <p>The properties or "rules" that the margin can contain can be described as <em>margin-top, margin-right, margin-bottom</em> and <em>margin-left</em> so you can specify how much space you would like from its surroundings with respect to position. you can also simply use <em>margin</em> to describe these values as well, the direction of which goes clockwise starting from the top.</p>
                <p><em><strong>for example:</strong></em></p>
                <div class="example">
                    <p>margin: 20px 10px 20px 10px;</p>
                </div>
                <p>The example above shows that margin has been set as 20px from top, 10px from right, 20px from bottom and 10px from left of element.</p>
                <p><u><strong>Note:</strong></u> The actual value of the margin can be negative. This would mean that you can actually set your elements to overlap!</p>
            <h3><em>What is Border?</em></h3>
                <p>Remember elements? Well like margins, borders can be applied to most HTML elements as well.</p>
                <p><em><strong>example of borders:</strong></em></p>
                <div class="border_solid">
                    <p>Solid</p>
                </div>
                <div class="border_dash">
                    <p>Dashed</p>
                </div>
                <div class="border_dot">
                    <p>Dotted</p>
                </div>
                <p>The examples shown above are the three most common types of borders that can be applied to most elements. Similar to margin, the thickness or <em>border-width</em> can be changed to any value you like. However, unlike margin, these values cannot be negative</p>
                <p>Below are a couple of examples of how to set <em>border-width</em> properties:</p>
                <div class="example">
                    <p>border-width: 10px</p>
                </div>
                <p>This method will set all sides of the border to 10px thickness, while</p>
                <div class="example">
                    <p>border-width: 10px 20px 10px 20px</p>
                </div>
                    <p>will set the top/bottom to 10px and right/left to 20px (clockwise like margin).</p>
                <p><u><strong>Note:</strong></u> If you take a closer look at the example of borders above, you will notice that the border is nested inside the gray area. This is because the elements have been preset with its maximum size in CSS, which means that the borders cannot exceed that limit.</p>
