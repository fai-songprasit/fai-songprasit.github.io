        <h1><strong>Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset</strong></h1>
            <h2>What is Neuroplasticity and how can its principles be benefitial?</h2>
                <p>Neuroplasticity refers to the brain's ability to adapt by forming new 
                    connections and pathways and change how its circuits are wired. It is 
                    the ability to undergo physiological changes which happen as the 
                    result of our interactions with our environment. The connections among 
                    the cells in our brains reorganize in response to our changing needs 
                    and learning experiences.</p>

                    <img src="../images/neuron.jpg" alt="picture of neuron" class="float_right">

                <p>Remember back when you had to learn the times table in math for the 
                    first time. That process of learning something new is hard, but as you 
                    keep repeating the times table aloud or in your head and started using 
                    it more and more in class, it slowly but surely got easier. 
                    
                <p>That's becasue we were in the initial phases of creating a new pathway 
                    in our brain that connects it to the relavent neurons. As we continue 
                    to use that path with more frequency, the path gets bigger in order to 
                    support the demand for that bit of information. If this principal of 
                    Neuroplasticity is applied to all new learning experiences then one 
                    can believe that with time and practice, we will always get better and 
                    faster at retrieving that information which in turn makes the new 
                    concepts easier to understand and faster to learn more in the long run.</p>
                
                <h3><em>How can you engage with the principals of neuroplasticity for your 
                    own benefits?</em></h3>
                    <p>Practice, practice and practice! What we have to concentrate on 
                        right now is to increase the frequency of use of that new neural 
                        pathway in as many forms as possible. Hopefully, in time, we would 
                        become more receptive towards new but relevant information on the 
                        topic, which in this case are programming and Web Development. </p>
                
                <h3><em>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</em></h3>
                    <p>In this case a few different learning mediums are being utilized 
                        to effectively increase neuroplasticity. Interactive channels like 
                        freecodecamp.com and Udacity are good examples as they both have 
                        an interactive side to the learning process, we are not just 
                        looking at some text on a page and hope that it doesn't just go in 
                        one eye socket and out the other. Youtube video tutorials and work 
                        alongs are the same concept except we are using a different 
                        stimulus (hearing) to help with the learning process. And then 
                        there are actual challenges and exercieses that we do to help 
                        strengthen that connection and improve understand via application.</p>
