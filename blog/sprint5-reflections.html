                        What was the hardest moment of this challenge for you?

                    <p>
                        The hardest moment was probably the countSurroundingMines function 
                        as I had initially made mistakes in the startGame( ) that affected 
                        the error messages while debigging. It took the better part of 2 
                        days of researching and trying something new before I eneded up 
                        asking another student for help.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I had blocks through pretty much all sections of this exercise. The 
                        first couple of times I took a little breather before trying 
                        something new. Then once I got stuck again I moved on to a different 
                        part of the exercise before coming back and having a look at it 
                        again after writing some pseudocode for it. I overcame it by asking 
                        for help from both another student and a facilitator.

                        Loop structure. When to use while loop instead of for loop in 
                        functions. Calling objects from array of objects and adding to them 
                        using functions. Separing functions into smaller more straight 
                        forward functions before putting it back in intended fuction via 
                        function call and why this is useful. Basically.... all of it?

                        Possibly write instructions to make them more clear as I found a lot 
                        of it quite difficult to follow at times. I feel like being able to 
                        write the surroundingMines fuction yourself may be helpful in 
                        understand the task a bit beter, although that would increase the 
                        time required to complete the exercise. I would also start the 
                        challenge off by explaining exatly what the initial array objects 
                        should include as things like, isMine, isMarked and surroundingMines 
                        could all be pushed to it later.

                    <p>
                        All in all, this was an excellent learning platform and a way to 
                        force a lot of critical thinking and problem solving. Despite how 
                        stressful it was at times, this whole exercise felt really rewarding.

                        Do you have any prior experience pair coding? If so, what was the 
                        experience like for you? If not, what is your initial reaction to 
                        pair programming?

                    <p>
                        I have never done pair programming. It looks like it could be 
                        chaotic to start off with but it could definitely be beneficial. I 
                        struggle on my own, especially as a begginer at times, with spelling 
                        mistakes and syntax errors but I find it quite easy to spot when 
                        watching a video tutorial of others coding.

                        Do you personally think working and pairing with others will be a 
                        challenge for you during bootcamp? Why so?

                    <p>
                        I dont think so unless the other person does not have a compatible 
                        personality and views. I find that this could potentially cause 
                        conflict and more harm than good. Some people may be prone to being 
                        more defensive than others while others may have low self-confidence 
                        and does not deal well with micro-management style of learning? I'm 
                        not opposed to it, personally I think I NEED it.
