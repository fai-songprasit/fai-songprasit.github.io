            <h2>Code Readability Primer</h2>
                <h3><em>What code readability habit will you begin implementing today?</em></h3>
                    <p>
                        Indentation and breaking things into smaller segments. Makes it 
                        easier for not only me to follow but for anyone else who might want 
                        to have a look at my code can easily navigate thorugh the 100s of 
                        lines of code.
                    </p>
                <h3><em>
                    Does code readability seem important to you, or unnecessarily fussy? 
                    Justify your answer.
                </em></h3>
                    <p>
                        It is important because not only is your work public (anyone can 
                        inspect and have a look) but this industry require a lot of 
                        collaboration and peer reveiew. There is no point in writing code 
                        in a way that no one else can follow, understand or work with.
                    </p>
            <h2>Code Readability Challenge</h2>
                <h3><em>As a developer, how important do you think indenting is?</em></h3>
                    <p>
                        Extremely!, in this industry we often work with a large group of 
                        people on a project so we have a responsibility not only to the 
                        computer that is running our program, but to pretty much every body 
                        else who will be using our code as well. I cant even imagine 
                        checking out someone's DOM to find what I found in the zen garden 
                        exercise... Made me so dizzy that I felt a bit sick.
                    </p>
                <h3><em>Do you prefer tabs or spaces when indenting?</em></h3>
                    <p>
                        Tabs, less button ressing and a nice amount of readable space.
                    </p>
                <h3><em>
                    What is your workspace like in real life? Clean? Messy? Is your code a 
                    reflection of that? Is your _downloads_ folder a reflection of that?
                </em></h3>
                    <p>
                        My work space is tidy and so is my code (considering my level of 
                        expertiese at the moment).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My downloads folder, however, is not. Although I never keep 
                        anything in there that I actively need, its contents are there for 
                        reference.
                    </p>
            <h2>Testing</h2>
                <p>
                    ```
                </p>
                <p>
                    function testSum(){
                </p>
                    <ul class = "nodot">
                        <li>var expected = 7</li>

                    </ul>
                    <ul class = "nodot">
                        <li>if (actual != expected) {</li>
                            <ul class = "nodot">

                            </ul>
                        <li>} else {</li>
                            <ul class = "nodot">
                                <li>console.log("It works!")</li>
                                <li>}</li>
                            </ul>
                        <li>}</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    ```
                </p>
                <h3><em>
                    Have a go at writing a function below that would make the above 
                    function print out `"It works!"`:
                </em></h3>
                    <p>
                        function sum(a, b){
                            <ul class = "nodot">
                                <li>return a + b</li>
                            </ul>

                    <p>
                        }
                    </p>
                <h3><em>
                    Do you think you would prefer using Unit Testing or Test Driven 
                    Development? Why?
                </em></h3>
                    <p>
                        I would prefer to use TDD. I find it easier (clarity-wise) to 
                        compartmentalise the big picture into smaller parts and outlining 
                        what I want out of things first before finding out what I actually 
                        need to do to get there. I feel that UT is more prone to mistakes 
                        if you are at my level (which is total noob) despite having the 
                        benefits of knowing exatly where went wrong but not why. I would 
                        rather answer a why question than a how one.
                    </p>
                <h3><em>
                    How could these techniques be used together to make code that is reliable?
                </em></h3>
                    <p>
                        We can begin with TDD and working backwards into UT. TDD will give 
                        us the frame work and the basic answers to our question while UT 
                        can be used to fine tune for more complex problem when we star 
                        building on the code to fulfill the bigger picture.
                    </p>
                <h3><em>
                    Was your initial response to the idea of testing, "That sounds useful" 
                    or "That sounds like a hassle"? Why?
                </em></h3>
                    <p>
                        I thought that looks like fun. I felt like I could learn better 
                        using the testing method as it would not only get me used to using 
                        and understanding functions but gain a basic understanding of what 
                        I should EXPECT the code to do.
                    </p>
            <h2>Repl.it - Code in your browser</h2>
                <h3><em>What was your first impression of the Repl.it website?</em></h3>
                    <p>
                        I like the interface. I like the feel of having someone walk you 
                        though set up (the typing word for word greeting) and how they have 
                        used a computer program but make it feel like it was actually a 
                        person on the other side was cool. I struggle with my compueter at 
                        the moment as it is very old and does not like to do more than one 
                        thing at once. The fact that I can have one place where I can see 
                        where I'm working from, where I can steal from, what I'm doing now 
                        and what I can get out of it immediately in just one place is 
                        pretty magical.
                    </p>
                <h3>How did you find using it in practice? Confusing? Useful?</h3>
                    <p>
                        I'm sure it will confuse me in due time but at the moment I'm 
                        finding it useful. Its quite a straight forward thing that is easy 
                        to follow even for total beginners like me. 
                    </p>
                <h3><em>
                    When you say the name of the website in your head, how are you 
                    pronouncing it? "REPLIT"? "REP-ILL-IT"? "REPELL-IT"?
                </em></h3>
                    <p>
                        "REPLIT"... I hope that is actually what it is cause otherwise 
                        it would be the whole how do you pronounce "anitipodes" all over 
                        again.

            <h2>Problem Solving and Pseudocode</h2>
                <h3><em>
                    Pick two problem solving techniques you would like to put into 
                    practice. Which ones have you chosen?
                </em></h3>
                    <p>
                        The rubber ducking technique! Because I already talk to myself 
                        regualarly to help me organise my thoughts anyway... and definitely 
                        Pseudocoding, being able to break things down in plain english into 
                        smaller steps will help me figure out what I have to do next.
                    </p>
                <h3><em>
                    How will you implement these techniques into your day to day coding 
                    flow? How will you make sure that you actually do them?
                </em></h3> 
                    <p>
                        As mentioned before I already practice rubber ducking without the 
                        rubber duck. I will probably have to aquire a rubber duck at some 
                        stage to actually use the rubber ducking technique. Right now my 
                        partner is standing in for the rubber duck (P.S. I also wanted to 
                        see how many times I can say rubber duck before someone gets 
                        frustrated.).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Like drawing a wire frame for my blog I till use Pseudocode to 
                        start off my process steps by step, if I dont know how to actally 
                        achieve some of the points I have written then I will do some 
                        research/ask for help before getting started so that I have a clear 
                        path to follow. Rubber ducking will be used for on the spot trouble 
                        shooting.
                    </p>
            <h2>JavaScript Variables and Object Types</h2>
                <h3><em> How did you find working through the Variables and Objects kata?</em></h3>
                    <p>
                        I'm guessing this was a warm up as it felt easy to understand and 
                        workthrough despite my lack of experience with JavaScript.
                    </p>
                <h3><em>Did you look at the tests while coding the kata? Was it helpful?</em></h3>
                    <p>
                        Yes, It gave me the best guidelines as to what it actually wanted 
                        to output. The error messages were useful only during debugging.
                    </p>
            <h2>Manipulating JavaScript Objects</h2>
                <h3><em></em></h3> What was the highlight of this kata for you?
                    <p>
                        WHEN IT WORKED!
                    </p>

                    Did you find you preferred following the steps given to you or using \
                    the test outputs in your repl? Why?
                </em></h3>
                    <p>
                        Neither as I tended to use both throughout. The instructions gave 
                        me a rough idea of what I needed to work towards and the tests 
                        showed me what it wanted. The outputs were most useful while 
                        debugging like the last kata. 
                    </p>
            <h2>FizzBuzz (Super Edition)</h2>
                <h3><em>What was the most challenging part of Super FizzBuzz for you?</em></h3>
                    <p>
                        Finding out what the correct function to use for replacing the 
                        numbers for its respective string.
                    </p>
                <h3><em>How did you find using pseudocode during this kata?</em></h3>
                    <p>
                        It was useful as an anchor. Everytime I got frustrated I looked 
                        back to see what my real objective was before trying something new 
                        again or pushing on to another aspect of the code. In the end I 
                        asked for help from a friend on slack who pointed out that I had 
                        some technical errors. Thank god.... Thought I was completely 
                        inadequate up until that point.

            <h2>JavaScript Gradebook</h2> 
                <h3><em>What was a surprising moment for you in this Gradebook Kata?</em></h3> 
                    <p>
                        The differences in referencing objects for sure. Took a while to 
                        understand why . couldnt be used in functions but [] for strings 
                        could. The readings did help but the slight lack of examples made 
                        it hard to understand until I actually say what the problem was 
                        myself in Repl.it.
                    </p>
                <h3><em>Did you go back and rewrite code as you got to new steps? Is there anything you would change about your final code?</em></h3> 
                    <p>
                        Yes, many times after the initial was written out according to the 
                        steps given on github. There is nothing that I'd like to change as 
                        it is already quite a small set of code... Except for maybe no so 
                        many spelling mistakes and calling errors this time.
                    </p>
            <h2>Built-in Methods</h2> 
                <h3><em>On a scale of 1 - 5, 5 means 'These built in methods are hard!' and 1 means 'Built in methods are easy.  Piece of cake' - how are you feeling following this Built-In-Methods kata?</em></h3>
                    <p>
                        I would say 3 as they were easy to understand but inorder to build the functions around the use of these methods required a bit of understanding and research.
                    </p>
                <h3><em>What resources did you use to help you? How useful did you find them?</em></h3>
                    <p>
                        Definitely developer.mozzilla.org JavaScript References. The examples are simple but shows exactly what kind of things are expected in the code inorder to be able to use them properly. W3 was also quite useful but not as easy to undertsand at first glance. We don't even want to talk about stack overflow.... too many people working on much more complicated projects than us.
