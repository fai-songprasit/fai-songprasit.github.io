        <h1><u><strong>My Reflections - Sprint Three</strong></u></h1>
            <h2>Mindfulness</h2>
                <h3><em>Have you done mindfulness or attention training before? </em></h3>
                    <p>I am a Thai Bhuddhist (yes there is a difference) and it was part 
                        of our practice when ever we visited the temple. Around once a 
                        month for 30min to 1 hour during service we would observe medition 
                        while listening to the sutras. Since moving to New Zealand, this 
                        practice was no longer followed and I have since been out of touch 
                        with it but understand the idea and the basics behind it. It is 
                        nice, to no have to spend 10mins of each morning calming the mind. 
                        I used to enjoy it once and I'm sure I will again.</p>
                <h3><em>Are you able to identify any bias you have for or against 
                    mindfulness?</em></h3>
                    <p>I've always been bias towards it, but that is because I belive in 
                        spirituality and mental peace. It is an internal journey that 
                        ultimately leads you to understanding what it means to do nothing 
                        and be alright with it. Taking time out of your day to calm your 
                        mind and reflect on the things you are thankful for, if done daily 
                        then I beleive that this will lead to a more positive 
                        predisposition rather than one of much negativity that a lot of 
                        people (myslef included) are prone to do.</p>
                <h3><em>What did you notice as you were meditating?</em></h3>
                    <p>That the mind shift's it focus very quickly and tries to find too 
                        much to concentrate on at the same time. It was hard to 
                        concentrate on one thing at first but after following the 
                        instructions it became quite instinctive to return to breathing. 
                        It shows that training the mind into a quiet state is possible 
                        with regular practice.</p>
                <h3><em>How did you find the overall experience?</em></h3>
                    <p>Very nice! I felt slightly tingly and energized afterwards. It was 
                        easier to concentrate on something without drifting but the 
                        duration of the productivity is still quite short. I trust that 
                        will soon change.</p>
                <h3><em>What's your daily habit commitment? </em></h3>
                    <p>Everyday after a small amount of morning routine, at 10am will be 
                        10mins of meditation before I begin my studies from now on.</p>
            <h2>Listening and Looping</h2>
                <h3><em>What was it like to be fully listened to?</em></h3>
                    <p>It was strange to do such intense listening to someone I've 
                        literally just met but atleast we had the same thing in comming to 
                        begin with.</p>
                    <p>The talking was interesting. It was terrifying at first as you are 
                        sitting there thinking "wow.... this person actually HAS to listen 
                        to 2mins of whatever drivel that comes out of my mouth" but that 
                        soon subsided as I remembered that we were actually talking about 
                        a predetermined topic.</p>
                <h3><em>What was it like to fully listen?</em></h3>
                    <p>The listening was easy as I am used to it with my job. The Loop 
                        technique required no interruptions throughout the 2mins process 
                        which allowed some time for reading my loop partner's expressions 
                        and pay attention to how speech was delivered as well, helps me 
                        understand what was being said with a little more insight into how 
                        the person felt.</p>
            <h2>Learning JavaScript</h2>
                <h3><em>What did you notice about your learning style? What resources 
                    worked for you and why?</em></h3>
                    <p>For this particular part of the course it requires a lot of 
                        understanding. I often referred to resources that showed a lot fo 
                        examples along side the explanations. I did ofcourse go through 
                        all the lessons on freecodecamp but found them to be extremely 
                        hard to understand at times. The language used was not very clear 
                        at explaining the way the certain functions, commands and 
                        structure worked. I used Udacity along side it to help supplement 
                        my lack of understanding in those parts.</p>
                <h3><em>Did you keep within the timebox suggestions? If not, was it due to 
                    difficulty understanding the basics, or a feeling like you had to 
                    "master" the basics?</em></h3>
                    <p>Yes I did keep withing the timebox but definitely feel that I will 
                        need a lot more time with the basics in order to "master" the 
                        basics of the language properly. About 75% of it made sense while 
                        the other 25% will need a few more hours of work.</p>
                <h3><em>If you did this entire exercise again, would you get stuck at the 
                    same points as you did the first time? Where did you get stuck?</em></h3>
                    <p>If I did this exercise again I believe that I will still get stuck 
                        at the same parts as it required me to remember/research the 
                        commands that are needed and how the code should be structured in 
                        order to produce the results that I want. I will likely get stuck 
                        at the same parts again because of their complex nature, most of 
                        the problem was my lack of command over the language and actually 
                        understanding what I have been asked to do. I got stuck on 
                        functions and loops the longest.</p>
            <h2>The DOM Primer and DevTools Primer</h2>
                <h3><em>Were you interested or bored during this exercise? Which parts 
                    were interesting? Which parts were boring?</em></h3>
                    <p>I was interested in what the DOM or The Document Object Model was 
                        and how it is connected with what we were learing. The basic gist 
                        of it was easily found in the articles and videos that I looked 
                        into but quickly grow bored when it came to the more indepth look 
                        into the DOM itself. Most of the resources spoke of the commands 
                        that can be used inside the DOM to manipulate and change data in 
                        HTML/JavaScript. Although examples were given and results shown, 
                        the lack of interactive aspect to the learning process made the 
                        content a little tedius.</p>
                <h3><em>How many tabs do you have open in your web browser right now? What 
                    is the ratio of study related tabs to distraction related tabs?</em></h3>
                    <p>I durrently have 8 tabs open and all of them are learning related...
                        but that doesn't mean that I dont have my phone right next to the 
                        computer.</p>
            <h2>DevTools Tutorial</h2>
                <h3><em>What did you notice about your learning style, strengths and 
                    limitations when doing this crash course?</em></h3>
                    <p>I initially tried to watch the whole video without interacting 
                        along with it (as I wasn't too sure how...) and my attention level 
                        plummeted. I just couldn't follow along well enough and quickly 
                        lost interest. I then got up, made myself a cup of tea (pomodoro) 
                        and walked around in circles (yes I do that when I'm frustrated) 
                        then proceeded to sit back down and re-read the learning 
                        objectives. I revisited the steps and links then managed to get a 
                        local version of the video working and strated to try the 
                        functions out with the video. It worked, I even thought some of 
                        the stuff was super cool dspite how some parts nearly killed my 
                        laptop (its very old). I think me strength (being tenacity) really 
                        paid off because I didn't give up but my limitations (lack of 
                        self-confidence/value) definitly got the better of me in the first 
                        half of the exercise.</p>
                <h3><em>Did any blocks come up for you? How did you overcome them?</em></h3>
                    <p>I think as outlined by the last point, I took a step back, had a 
                        look at the content again to properly gain an understanding, then 
                        jumped right back in. I find that I need to be DOING something 
                        like work with it or take notes inorder for the knowledge to sink 
                        in to a certain degree.</p>
                <h3><em>Did you do something funny with the Dev Tools, like insert your 
                    own name or some inappropriate words into the DOM of a website?</em></h3>
                    <p>Yes... Shamelessly so.... but will not be showing the general 
                        public what I have done (haha!).</p>
