        <h1><strong><u>The inner workings of Web Pages</u></strong></h1>
            <h2>Web pages 101</h2>
                <p>Imagine a web page as a movie set. The screenplay and scripts are written as the 
                    skeleton of how the film should progress. Then you have to decide on how many people 
                    you need for the camera crew, which actors to cast and what special effects you think 
                    might make this movie a new Blockbuster smasher. Then you have the director, he helps 
                    make the decisions if and where needed but his time to shine is when the stage is 
                    set, the actors are casted and filming commences. He interprets the script (assuming 
                    that he didn't write it this time) and directs the actors through the motions needed 
                    in any given scene. he then decides on what special effects to use where and how 
                    often (if at all) certain scenes should show up in the film for it all to come 
                    together as the final product. Thinking about it though, the film would have worked 
                    out just fine with just the crew (cast included), but having a director there in 
                    charge of how they all interact and how the film is put together could be the 
                    difference between making Blockbuster smasher or just your average movie.</p>

                <img src="../images/javascript.jpeg" alt="JavaSript, CSS and HTML works together" class="float_right">

                <p>A web page is kind of like that, there are different styles of code that is needed to 
                    put it together. The HTML being the skeleton structure, CSS being the cast, crew and 
                    special effects, and JavaScript as the director. Like the example above, a web page 
                    could just be completely made up of HTML and CSS files and it would still be a fully 
                    functioning page. But if you want the it to do more than just be pretty, like have 
                    some kind of interactive feature to increase the level of engagement or have a pop up 
                    message whenever someone subscribes to your blog, then you want JavaScrpit. To put it 
                    more simply, HTML provides a website with its structure, CSS concerns itself with how 
                    the page is presented and JavaScrpit deals with how the page behaves when someone 
                    interacts with it.</p>

            <h2>Getting right into it!</h2>
                <p>You can control many aspects of your website when it comes to the interactive side of 
                    things. JavaScript, as mentioned above, is in charge of all of that. A good example 
                    is at the bottom of a Trademe listing, you will find something like this:</p>

                <img src="../images/viewcount.png" alt="example of view count" class="float_left1">

                <p>This count is updated everytime someone clicks on the listing to have a look at the 
                    listing. This count uses a "loop" function that was written as part of the page's 
                    JavaScript code.</p>

                <h3><em>What is loop?</em></h3>
                    <p>There is a little bit more going on with loop than just a few lines of code on a 
                        page. Loop is part of what we call a "function", it is a set of rules that each 
                        interaction with the page must go through (if it is there) before it produces a 
                        result that we see on the web page. Loops are used to repeatedly run a block of 
                        code - until a certain condition is met.</p>
                    
                    <img src="../images/shower.jpeg" alt="cartoon having a shower" class="float_right">

                    <p><em>An example of when everyone "loops" in daily life is your shower routine. You 
                        walk in, lock the door behind you (or don't...), get undressed (or don't...), 
                        jump in, have a quick rinse, lather some soap on you, rinse again and repeat this 
                        process the same way daily.</em></p>

                    <p>Getting back into functions for a bit. The results of these functions are 
                        dependent on which set of rules it has followed to produce the answer that we 
                        get. These rules follow a procedure called "control flow", the order of which the 
                        rules should be made. The interations go through each set of rules until an 
                        answer is found or it has come to the end of it's preset looping point (e.g. stop 
                        counting at 50), then and only then does the function stop looping. The control 
                        flow basically gives us a guideline of how we should set the rules in the order 
                        we want the webpage to go through so that it can get all the information that it 
                        needs before it produces an answer.</p>

                    <p><em>You are a typical 9am to 5pm worker who only works Monday to Friday. You have 
                        two ways of getting to work, cylcing and busing, depending on what the weather is 
                        doing that day. Your thought process would first start with what day of the week 
                        it is. If it is between Monday and Friday then you would need to go to work. You 
                        then look outside to see if the weather is nice, if it is, you'll cycle, if not, 
                        you'll take the bus. Now if you change the order of that same train of thought to 
                        first check the weather before checking what day of the week it is, you may find 
                        yourslef half way to work on a Saturday or Sunday regardless of which method you 
                        decided to take to get there.</em></p>

            <h2>What is DOM and why is it relevant to all of this?</h2>
                <h3><em>What is DOM?</em></h3>
                <img src="../images/DOM.png" alt="example of DOM" class="float_left2">
                    <p><strong>Document Object Model</strong> or <strong>DOM</strong> is a programming 
                        interface for HTML (the skeleton of your web page). It represents the page so 
                        that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM 
                        represents the document as nodes and objects. That way, programming languages can 
                        connect to the page.</p>

                    <p>As seen in the diagram, DOM is often referred to as a tree, working its way from 
                        the root to the branches connecting all the nodes and objects that the HTML file 
                        contains. Its is a bird's eye view of what the code looks like with the option of 
                        inspecting and interacting with each of the branches/elements in the code.</p>

                    <p>Every web browser has a DOM function embedded into it to varying degrees of power. 
                        This means that every web page can be interacted with/manipulated on site. You 
                        can do this by right clicking your mouse or trackpad and navigating down to 
                        "inspect".</p>
                    
                    <p><em><strong><u>NOTE:</u></strong> If you are feeling mischievous, YES! You can 
                        change whatever you see on a web page but keep in mind that these changes are not 
                        permanent. They will revert back to what they were when the page is 
                        refreshed!</em></p>
