        <h1><strong><u>The inner workings of Web Pages</u></strong></h1>
            <h2>Web pages 101</h2>
                <p>Imagine a web page as a movie set. The screenplay and scripts are written as the 
                    skeleton of how the film should progress. Then you have to decide on how many people 
                    you need for the camera crew, which actors to cast and what special effects you think 
                    might make this movie a new Blockbuster smasher. Then you have the director, he helps 
                    make the decisions if and where needed but his time to shine is when the stage is 
                    set, the actors are casted and filming commences. He interpret the script (assuming 
                    that he didn't write it this time) and directs the actors through the motions needed 
                    in any given scene. he then decides on what special effects to use where and how 
                    often (if at all) certain scenes should show up in the film for it all to come 
                    together as the final product. Thinking about it though, the film would have worked 
                    out just fine with just the crew (cast included), but having a director there in 
                    charge of how they all interact and how the film is put together could be the 
                    difference between making Blockbuster smasher or just your average movie.</p>

                <p>A web page is kind of like that, there are different styles of code that is needed to 
                    put it together. The HTML being the skeleton stucture, CSS being the cast, crew and 
                    special effects, and JavaScript as the director. Like the example above, a web page 
                    could just be completely made up of HTML and CSS files and it would still be a fully 
                    functioning page. But if you want the it to do more than just be pretty, like have 
                    some kind of interactive feature to increase the level of engagement or have a pop up 
                    message whenever someone subscribes to your blog, then you want JavaScrpit. To put it 
                    more simply, HTML provides a website with its structure, CSS concerns itself with how 
                    the page is presented and JavaScrpit deals with how the page behaves when someone 
                    interacts with it.</p>

                <p>So if you look at a web page as a working engine...
