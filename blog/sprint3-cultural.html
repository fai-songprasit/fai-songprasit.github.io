        <h1>What is the difference between EQ and IQ?</h1>
            <p>IQ is mostly about the brain and how it registers information. EQ is about 
                emotions and how a person interprets and control both their own and 
                other's emotional states.</p>
            <h2>What is IQ?</h2>
                <p>IQ, short for <em>intelligence quotient</em>, is a measure of a 
                    person's reasoning abiity. An intelligence quotient (IQ) is a score 
                    derived from one of several standardized tests designed to assess 
                    intelligence.</p>
                <p>In short, it is supposed to gauge how well someone can use information 
                    and logic to answer questions or make predictions. IQ tests begin to 
                    assess this by measuring short- and long-term memory. They also 
                    measure how well people can solve puzzles and recall information 
                    they’ve heard — and how quickly.</p>
                <p>The abilities that are tested and outlined by IQ are the ability to 
                    learn, understand and apply information to skills, logical reasoning, 
                    word comprehension, math skills, abstract and spatial thinking, filter 
                    irrelevant information.</p>
            <h2>What is EQ?</h2>
                <p>Emotional Quotient (aka emotional intelligence or EQ) is defined as the 
                    way to perceive and interpret emotions. Being able to name and 
                    regulate emotions to enhance your personal growth intellectually and 
                    emotionally.</p>

                            people, what motivates them and how to work cooperatively with 
                            them,”</em></p>

                    emotions; use emotions to facilitate thinking, understand emotional

                                positive or a negative attitude, you can with effort and 
                                practice learn to think more positively. Motivation is
