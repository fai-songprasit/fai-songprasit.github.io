        <h1><strong><u>Some Q&A about me</u></strong></h1>
            <h3><em>What is your long term goal and or career pathway?</em></h3>
                <p>I have been working in hospitality for a VERY long time. Pretty much since I was 
                    old enough to have an IRD number. I went to university and completed a degree 
                    in Commerce hoping that I might find a job that I would enjoy more than 
                    Hospitality, but in the end I went back to it. So my long term goal is really 
                    to find a new pathway to soemthing else that I will enjoy more in the long run 
                    that has a little more progression in terms of both knowledge and position. In 
                    all honesty I don't have a career pathway in mind as long as it lets me 
                    constantly upskill while still being able to enjoy what I do (or the job).</p>
            <h3><em>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in 
                yourself while at EDA?</em></h3>
                <p>What I have always struggled with in life that I have noticed a long time ago, 
                    after having worked in hospitality for so long, is that I am unable to control 
                    the "panic" stage of my being. An example of that is when I encounter 
                    criticism, be it constructive or no, gives me a sense of panic that sends me 
                    into a slightly self-deprecating state. I am often unable to control the 
                    magnitude of the effects that it leaves me with and am hoping to be able to 
                    develop that skill further in EDA as giving and receiving feedback and 
                    criticism is an important aspeft of the course and its values.</p>
            <h3><em>A description of your strengths and limitations</em></h3>
                <p>At first it was hard to recognise my strengths, as I almost always seem to see 
                    the limitations that it brings me afterwards but here goes.
                </p>
                <p>My strengths lies in my tenacity and stubborness. As mentioned in the previous 
                    cultural blog, I find that I am a determined and passionate person when it 
                    comes to the things that I care about. I will always see things through to the 
                    end and put everything into it, be it work or leisure. Note that it doesnt mean 
                    I dont know how to relax because I dont think anyone is enjoying this 
                    quarentine as much as I am right now.</p>
                <p>My limitations are inline with my strengths, it is often the by-product of the 
                    process if and when it goes wrong. Because I care about my work, I often feel 
                    that I can always be doing better, that there is always a better way to do 
                    things and communicate them to people in a more effctive way. This may sound 
                    like a good thing but when it is constant, even when things don't go wrong, it 
                    results in a slight depreciation in self-value.</p>
            <h3><em>Based on the above description, a commitment to how you will manage your 
                workload in this programme. This should include - an explanation of how you will 
                manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators 
                and industry/community representatives.</em></h3>
                <p>I will be utilizing the "think like a programmer" model and where possibly apply 
                    the "divide workload" tactic. Using that style of work in the course will 
                    reduce the amount of "panic" that I will feel from the sheer amount of learning 
                    and work that will come of this course. It is within my expectation that this 
                    will also increase productivity and will reflect possitively in a team base 
                    learning environment.</p>
                <p>Meditation, as suggested in sprint 3 and the practice of mindfulness will also 
                    be benefitial to pad my downtime (home environment) as well. Making it a habit 
                    will help me to separate the parts of my day where different levels of 
                    engagement is required.</p>
            <h3><em>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.</em></h3>
                <p>I am acustomed to seeking help if and when needed. I worked in an extremely high 
                    pressure environment with a dynamic team. Not only will I be able to seek out 
                    help, I am also able to divide my time so that help can be given as well. I 
                    will never try to achieve more than I am physically able and should the 
                    situation calls for it, I will speak directly to the person who is most 
                    available and relavant to me at that time (be it students and instructors alike).</p>
            <h3><em>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</em></h3>
                <p>Possitive energy! I trust that with their experience they will be able to best 
                    recognize those who are in need of help and provide suitable advice on how to 
                    overcome the problem. I understand that the facilitation team are not 
                    councillors and that they are there to help whenever any of us reaches out.</p>
            <h3><em>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to 
                other things. For example, you might have whanau commitments such as school 
                drop-offs. Itâ€™s important to plan these in.</em></h3>
                <p>None that I can think of considering I will be quitting my job to go through 
                    Bootcamp! My partner works evenings so will see if I can have a couple of 
                    evenings off to spend time with them when I can.</p>
