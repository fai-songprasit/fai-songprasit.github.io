            <h1><strong>My learning Journey</strong></h1>
            <h3>
                What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a 
                result of the core learning?
            </h3>
                <img src="../images/compare.jpg" alt="comparing yourself to others" 
                class="float_left">
                <p>
                     The first thing I learned was that I cannot help but compare my learning progress with other's despite understanding that everyone comes into this with different backgrounds, level of technical experience and strengths. I know that some have much stronger technical skills while others are more comfortable with core, but after seeing the quality of work being produced makes it hard to be completely satisfied.
                </p>
                <img src="../images/perfectionism.png" alt="lining up skittles" 
                class="float_right">
                <p>
                    The second is that my perfectionistic tendencies really gets in the way of progress. It makes it hard for me to jump in and try something new off the top of my head. I would much rather do a lot of research into the topics first before trying a concept that I suspect might also work in a similar way. A lot of the time the research does provide a good brief basis but the knowledge that I have gained from practice thus far and seeking help when needed has been far more useful.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The third is relevant to both the above points, mostly that perfectionism makes it hard sometimes to be completely satisfied with my work when It doesn't ever feel complete. I look at other's work and I think about how much time they put in and how much they have achieved, comparing my work to them all the time. I constantly feel like there is always so much left to do but need to put it on hold as it would hinder my progress through the course work.
                </p>
            <h3>
                What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and 
                programming?
            </h3>
                <p>
                    I feel that personal values encompasses all parts of my learning. It more or less dictates how i will intreact with the people I will be leaning with, how I approach learning and how I deal I see my progress.
                </p>
                <img src="../images/self-awareness.jpg" alt="sailing though a fog" 
                class="float_right">
                <p>
                    Empathy allows me to see my progress and other's as part of one and the same process. Understanding where, how and why others progress at the rate that they do while at the same time being kind to myself and my learning.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Self-awareness is possibly the most important part of learning progamming, as I see it as being of paramount importance when it comes to reflecting on your work at the end of each learning week. Being highly aware means that I can constantly strive to improve on the things that I see as deficient at that stage and learn from my mistakes.
                </p>

                Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time 
                focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?

                Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of 
                time? Should you have just used that time to practicing programming instead? 
                Justify your answer.
