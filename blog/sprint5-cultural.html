            <h1><strong>My learning Journey</strong></h1>
            <h3>
                What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a 
                result of the core learning?
            </h3>
                <img src="../images/compare.jpg" alt="comparing yourself to others" 
                class="float_left">
                <p>
                     The first thing I learned was that I cannot help but compare my 
                     learning progress with other's despite understanding that everyone 
                     comes into this with different backgrounds, level of technical 
                     experience and strengths. I know that some have much stronger technical 
                     skills while others are more comfortable with core, but after seeing 
                     the quality of work being produced makes it hard to be completely 
                     satisfied.
                </p>
                <img src="../images/perfectionism.png" alt="lining up skittles" 
                class="float_right">
                <p>
                    The second is that my perfectionistic tendencies really gets in the way 
                    of progress. It makes it hard for me to jump in and try something new 
                    off the top of my head. I would much rather do a lot of research into 
                    the topics first before trying a concept that I suspect might also work 
                    in a similar way. A lot of the time the research does provide a good 
                    brief basis but the knowledge that I have gained from practice thus far 
                    and seeking help when needed has been far more useful.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The third is relevant to both the above points, mostly that 
                    perfectionism makes it hard sometimes to be completely satisfied with my 
                    work when It doesn't ever feel complete. I look at other's work and I 
                    think about how much time they put in and how much they have achieved, 
                    comparing my work to them all the time. I constantly feel like there is 
                    always so much left to do but need to put it on hold as it would hinder 
                    my progress through the course work.
                </p>
            <h3>
                What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and 
                programming?
            </h3>
                <p>
                    I feel that personal values encompasses all parts of my learning. It 
                    more or less dictates how i will intreact with the people I will be 
                    leaning with, how I approach learning and how I deal I see my progress.
                </p>
                <img src="../images/self-awareness.jpg" alt="sailing though a fog" 
                class="float_right">
                <p>
                    Empathy allows me to see my progress and other's as part of one and the 
                    same process. Understanding where, how and why others progress at the 
                    rate that they do while at the same time being kind to myself and my 
                    learning.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Self-awareness is possibly the most important part of learning 
                    progamming, as I see it as being of paramount importance when it comes 
                    to reflecting on your work at the end of each learning week. Being 
                    highly aware means that I can constantly strive to improve on the things 
                    that I see as deficient at that stage and learn from my mistakes.
                </p>
            <h3>
                What has surprised you the most about the core learning?
            </h3>
                <p>
                    I'm surprised that Enspiral has put so much thought into actually 
                    teaching this aspect of human values and behaviour in the course. The 
                    contents are both interesting, relevant and frankly quite fun to 
                    navigate through. I understand that these core concepts are useful in 
                    all job types, tech or no, but to invest so much time in also teaching 
                    this has outlined what I can expect from myself at the end of my 
                    learning journey here. Which is ultimately to get employment and what 
                    employers expect to see in a potential candidate aside from their 
                    technical skills.
                </p>
            <h3>
                What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?
            </h3>
                <p>
                    The most challenging aspect for me was forming a learning plan and 
                    sticking to it. I find it quite difficult to commit to a certain type of 
                    routine especially at this stage where so much time is being spent at 
                    home and having no clear divide in down time and study time. Usually 
                    when I had the option of studying on campus during my university days, 
                    it was easier to separate my time more efficiently. Goals were more laid 
                    out and definied, while now the lines are somewhat blurred. There is a 
                    lot more flexibility in my routine because I needed to allow my time to 
                    be divided across many things while we are all completly overcome by 
                    uncertainty that is affecting my daily life amidst COVID-19.
                </p>
            <h3>
                Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time 
                focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?
            </h3>
                <img src="../images/jobhunting.jpg" alt="job application process" 
                class="float_left">
                <p>
                    I think that Enspiral is taking the time to focus on human skills (or 
                    soft skills) because for most of us when we are done here will need to 
                    move into a professional programming environment. Where projects are 
                    worked on in teams and divisions in order to optimize the output of one 
                    product. This requires collaboration and understand of everyone's 
                    situtation and working environment. Being taught to be aware of the core 
                    skills early on will make it easy for transition from training to work 
                    and make us more desirable as a potential candidate.
                </p>
            <h3>
                Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of 
                time? Should you have just used that time to practicing programming instead? 
                Justify your answer.
            </h3>
                <p>
                    Not at all! The concepts are interesting and relavent. I have learned a 
                    lot more about myself than I had anticipated and the process has helped 
                    me find the most effective way for me to engage the material. Not only 
                    that but it has also allowed me to be a little bit more kind to myself 
                    when it came to assessing my own progress and ability to learn.
                </p>
            <h2>
                Reflecting while preparing for Bootcamp
            </h2>
                <img src="../images/trapped.jpg" alt="what now?" 
                class="float_right">
                <p>
                    The past 5 weeks has been both challenging and fun. It makes me think 
                    about why I am doing this in the first place. It all came down to me 
                    wanting to change my lifestyle and find a new challenge. COVID-19 has 
                    put any hopes of me moving to another country and writing a wine list 
                    for a Michelin Star restaurant on hold for a while, if not permanently. 
                    While I know that my love, experience and passion for wine will never 
                    disappear, my job will. This pandemic has really lowered the ceiling for 
                    me and my career, I can now see a roof where I used to see sky and it 
                    has really driven home that I needed to make a change.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What I really want out of this course was to find something else that I 
                    could love as much as wine. I want the chance to be in a job where the 
                    possibilities are next to limitless when it comes to learning and to be 
                    given the ability to change more than just me. I'm not like my sister 
                    who wants to make life online easier for people with disability or like 
                    some of the friends that I have in the industry who wants to make the 
                    most beautiful indie game in New Zealand. I don't have a grand scheme 
                    or bigger picture in mind for where I want to take these skills but I 
                    think that's what I'm here to find out. I wanted to be challenged so 
                    here I am, changing my whole life to satisfy my curiosity and great need 
                    for change.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Heading into this Bootcamp after foundation has highlighted what my 
                    strengths and limitations are. As mentioned in my 
                    <a href="blog/sprint2-cultural.html">About Me</a> blog entry from sprint 
                    2, I feel that my strengths and limitations have remained more or less 
                    the same. My tenacity and stubbourness are still my key strengths, 
                    especially when it comes to learning. If I hadn't been so determined to 
                    try and prove myself wrong by pushing through the material and telling 
                    myself that I am not allowed to give up then I think I would have lapsed 
                    into a depressive state by now. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    My limitation is definitely still my perfectionistic tendencies. It has 
                    been holding me back at almost every step of the way, telling me that 
                    the work needs to be absolutely amazing or else I can't move on to the 
                    next stage. Luckily, with effort, the nagging voice has calmed down a 
                    little. I suspect that this will definitely still hinder me during 
                    Bootcamp.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge that I think I will likely encounter during 
                    Bootcamp, aside from managing my limitations, would be keeping on top of 
                    the material. I anticipate a lot of information and practice that are 
                    needed and not enough hours in the day to do it so my main focus from 
                    here on out will be to fully prepare myself as much as possible before 
                    every Bootcamp week. Making sure that I have done a reasonable amount of 
                    study and familiarisation before the course delivery inorder to keep my 
                    bad habbits under wraps.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I would be lying by saying that there is no part of me that I wish to 
                    change. I think compared to other, my human skills far surpass my 
                    technical skills thanks to my professional background but what I have 
                    never been good at was receiving feedback in a way that doesn't have a 
                    negative effect on me mentally. I am prone to being unreasonably harsh 
                    on myslef, in saying that, I am a fairly confident person but I find it 
                    hard to be kind to myself in the face of critism. I hope that I can 
                    become more comfortable with this by the end of this course. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    In my understanding, Bootcamp is like foundations times three. I intend to approch Bootcamp with more preparations and dedication, while maintaining the useful habits that I have acheive over the past 5 weeks. I am acustomed to working long hours under an immense amount of pressure so I am confident that I will remain composed throughout. Communication is key when it comes to working with others so I intend to be as communicative and informative as possible when dealing with others. Making sure that everyone is aware of what is happening is the best way to manage any and all expectations, while maintaining a good relationship with the poeple around me. Thse two points will be my key startegies throughout Bootcamp.
