                What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?
            </h2>

            <h2>
                What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?
            </h2>

            <h2>
                What has surprised you the most about the core learning?
            </h2>

            <h2>
                What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?
            </h2>

            <h2>
                Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?
            </h2>
            
            <h2>
                Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practicing programming instead? Justify your answer.
