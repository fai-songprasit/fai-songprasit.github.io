            <h2>Your Blog</h2>
                <h3>
                    <em>Describe what you did in this exercise. Did you understand the 
                    steps that you were making? Can you describe them in simple terms?</em>

                    <p>
                        I was to set up a basic template of the blog that I will be working on for the rest of foundations. I was asked to create a new directory in my repository to work on and add work to. the 
                        .html is my website skeleton and the .css file is for adding 
                        specific charactoristics to it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Yes I did understand the steps that I was making as seen on 
                        tutorial video. Simply put I was asked to create a website that 
                        can be used on an internet broweser. I was asked to then add a 
                        component to that file that will allow me to make stylistic 
                        changes to the page. I was then asked to link the style changes to 
                        my website of plain text for future adjustments.

                        I have successfully achieved the lerning competencies and kepth

                    <p>
                        I chose to work on both freecodecamp and Udacity. I liked 
                        freecodecamp because everything you need is on one screen that is 
                        split clearly onto 3 sections. You track or test your progress as 
                        you work. The instructions are helpful but it does give quite a 
                        bit away at times.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Udacity is an awesome work along media based platform that left a 
                        little bit of room for the imagination and had useful quizzes to 
                        break up the lerning progress to help with your understanding. The 
                        coding practice wasn't quite as useful or intuative as 
                        freecodecamp but the rate or learning and explanations are better 
                        for complete beginners like myself.

                        Most of the problems I encountered were in a actual definition or 
                        DOM, responsive wed design and semantic. I understand these works 
                        (except for DOM) in a normal context but not in html. It wasn't 
                        until after some research post freecodecamp and Udacity exercises 
                        that explained exactly what it was and how relevant it was to what 
                        I had just learnt. Technically speaking, responsive web design 
                        gave me the most trouble as the concepts were a little hard to get 
                        used to. I used a lot of Youtube video examples and refered them 
                        back to the lessons for additional practice in order to gain a 
                        better understanding of the functions and how they actually apply 
                        in real time.

                <h3><em>What were you most proud of during this challenge?</em></h3>
                    <p>
                        That after a good chunk of work and research I actually managed to 
                        get it without needing to get in touch with a tutor. Of course not 
                        all of it, I would definitely not say that I am fluent but I 
                        understand the concepts and wite a basic semantic structure 
                        without needed reference. The CSS component will need a bit of 
                        work but I am confident that i can create and work with in without 
                        assistence.

                <h3><em>Did you keep within the timebox suggestions?</em></h3>
                    <p>
                        Used about an hour less than listed for the platform exercises and 
                        about 15mins less for the online research phase so in short, Yes.
                    </p>
                <h3>
                    <em>How much faster could you do it if you started from the beginning 
                    again, right now?</em>
                </h3>
                    <p>
                        I would probably be able to cut down the platform exercises by 
                        about 1/3 of the time as I wouldn't really need to take a minute 
                        to unserstand what it's actually asking me to do.

                        When my sister and I were younger and had more time on our hands, 
                        we often spoke about one day open a bakery. I, being the less 
                        artistic one, would design the menu and crate the base for all of 
                        our products. Things like yeast starters, baking simple spongues 
                        and kneading and prepping various dough. My sister would then use 
                        that product and turn them into various delights. She was dress 
                        the cake with icing, add filling to strudles and dressing little 
                        sweet treats. She would then decide on where to put it on display 
                        in our little shop so that the customers would look at them and 
                        think them delicious (and ultimately buy them). I, in this case 
                        would be the html, creating a structure and filling it with 
                        content. My sister would then be CSS, applying an aesthetic appeal 
                        to the wedsite while making it user friendly at the same time. The 
                        things that I make, being the menu and base product would be the 
                        semantic elements and structure, while my sister would fill to 
                        product with designs and userbility for different types of people, 
                        what ever the need.

                </h3>
                    <p>
                        The main problem that I had was the actual structure, trying the 
                        get the blocks in each section to align. I spent about 3 hours 
                        reserching and tweaking the the CSS style when it finally worked. 
                        I also went back to some of the freecodecamp lessons and used 
                        W3Schools a mojor reference for code structure and style.

                <h3><em>Any moments of surprise or joy?</em></h3>
                    <p>
                        To be honest it was more frustration followed by relief for the 
                        most part. The joy wasn't felt until the end when everything 
                        finally worked and reviewing the content using "inspect". Joy came 
                        with understanding that what I had written had made sense and felt 
                        like we were finally speaking the language.

                        HTML would be a chicken and CSS would be a peacock. The people 
                        will look at the chicken and be able to say that its a bird, does 
                        very little but it does all the things a bird should do. Then 
                        there's the peacock, while it is most definitely a bird, it a 
                        pretty one that not only looks nice but can fly better than a 
                        chicken can.
